        the Dark Lord who tried to kill Harry Potter because the boy was prophesied to destroy him. Voldemort murdered
        Harry's parents, James and Lily, but as a result of his mother's love and willingness to sacrifice herself for
        him, baby Harry survived when Voldemort tried to murder him with a Killing Curse. Voldemort was disembodied, and
        Harry was left with a mysterious, lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead as a result.</span>
